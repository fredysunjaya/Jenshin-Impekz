The scrambling web of rivers has grown into a flourishing and wide-spread ecosystem full of flora and fauna — an awe-inspiring sight for travelers to the area.

The view from the top of the inn is jaw-dropping — weather permitting you can see all the way to Mt. Qingce and Jueyun Karst in the distance. Legend amongst the stalls says that the tower of the inn hides a mysterious secret, but that's as far as the legend goes, as no-one has ever been able to validify the claims."

The area hides many stunning views, but owing to tracks found on the complex paths leading up the peaks, a legend has formed that the hidden home of the Adepti lies somewhere in the area. Though another factor may simply be the hopes of those that seek blessings from the Adepti. Given the dangers within, the area is not suitable for outsiders. Best viewed from afar at Wangshu Inn."

Although its skull still looks up at the sky defiantly, the god is already dead, and so the name of \"Watatsumi Omikami\" is gradually being forgotten. Even if the giant serpent is long dead, you can still clearly feel the traces of its power left behind. Under the influence of the Tatarigami, Yashiori Island has been deserted by its inhabitants.
